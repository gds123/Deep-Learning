Project Overview:
In this research paper we apply the methodology out-lined in the arXiv working paper: ”Joint Deep Modeling of Users and Items Using Reviews for Recommendation” for rating prediction of movies using the Amazon Instant Video data set and GloVe.6B 50 dimensional word embeddings. Of the data set there are only 18,000  text reviews. The approach used in this paper models users and items jointly using review text in two cooperative neural networks.
